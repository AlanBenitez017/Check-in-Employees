# Check-in-Employees
This project is a GUI used by employees of a company, where employees need to check-in, check-out, break for lunch and returning from lunch.
Furthermore, it can print all the registers of an employee given the ID of the employee. It can also modify and delete some registers that the employee made.
All the entries will be stored in a database.
